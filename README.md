# Overview of the analysis:

In this module I have performed an analysis for PyBer, a ride-sharing app company. In this analysis I examined the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 in order to create a compelling visualization for the CEO of the company.  My analysis began with a breakdown of rides by city type, then I was able to caculate statistics like the average fare per city type and average fare per driver in each city type.  These insights will allow the CEO to make decisions regarding future allocation of resources.  

# Results:

A breakdown by city type illustrates significant differences in ride-share use between Urban, Suburban, and Rural locations.  Urban locations have the most overall rides, while Rural locations have the least.  Additionally Urban locations have a much larger number of drivers than the other two city types.  Urban locations also have the highest total fares, however Rural locations represent the highest average fare per ride.  Because Rural locations have the fewest number of drivers and highest average fare per ride, drivers in Rural locations have the highest average fare per driver.  Conversely in Urban locations where there are a large number of rides, but also an extremely high number of drivers, drivers in Urban locations have the lowest average fare per driver.

# Summary:

My analysis of ride-share data in various city types has illustrated that Urban cities are oversaturated with drivers, while the other two city types show room for growth.  One suggestion for addressing disparities between city types would be to limit the number of drivers eligible in Urban cities.  This would allow current enrolled drivers to make a higher average fare per driver. Another suggestion would be to incentivise drivers to sign up in Rural cities, which would lower wait times and potentially increase users in Rural areas.  Finally, an analysis including length of ride and how many rides each driver takes would help increase the effectiveness of this analysis.  A final suggestion would be to investigate additional data sets in order to refine the analysis.
